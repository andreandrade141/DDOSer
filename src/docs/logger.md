- The STATUS code field will output the HTTP code of the request.W(If there's an error prior to the request the code will appear as 0).

- The RESULT field will output the status of the operation (DONE or FAIL) and a small description of itÂ´s procedures.

- The TOTAL TIME field will output the total time that took to execute the request module.

## Module Logic

1. The module controller will receive the log input and send it to one of two functions -> faillog or successlog.

2. The two works the same way, by treating the information and preformatting it before sending it to the logwriter function

3. The logwriter function is responsible for formatting all the info and showing it in the format mentioned above.
